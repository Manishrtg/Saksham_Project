            <p>At <strong>Saksham</strong>, we are committed to transforming the education system by boosting the infrastructure and facilities of government schools across Karnataka and beyond. Our initiative is aimed at providing children in government schools with an enriched learning environment that fosters growth, creativity, and academic excellence.</p>

            <p>Under the guidance of <strong>Professor Gopal Naik</strong> from <strong>IIM Bangalore</strong>, and with the unwavering support of the esteemed faculty and students of IIM Bangalore, we have built a platform that bridges the gap between underfunded schools and those who wish to help make a difference.</p>

            <p>We believe that every child deserves access to quality education, and through this project, we strive to create a lasting impact on the education system of our country.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>We understand that the needs of each government school are unique, and addressing those needs requires a comprehensive approach. Our process is structured into several key steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>On-Ground Research & Assessment</strong>: Our team of dedicated professionals, including students and faculty from IIM Bangalore, visit government schools across Karnataka. We assess the school’s facilities, infrastructure, and overall environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Estimation and Proposal Creation</strong>: After documenting the deficiencies, we work with local vendors and experts to estimate the cost of improvements. A proposal is created outlining these costs and expected outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fundraising and Donations</strong>: We approach NGOs, corporates, and individual donors for funding. Donations are directly used for school improvements, and donors are updated regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation and Monitoring</strong>: Once funds are raised, we initiate improvements, monitoring progress to ensure quality standards are met.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion and Long-Term Vision</strong>: Initially focused on Karnataka, we plan to expand this initiative nationwide, bringing quality education to more schools across India.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why Government Schools?</h3>
    <p>Government schools play a crucial role in providing education to children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. However, these schools often face numerous challenges such as outdated infrastructure and a lack of resources. By supporting these schools, we aim to level the playing field and ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background.</p>

    <p>Our focus is on addressing the critical gaps in infrastructure, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classroom Furniture</strong>: Providing desks, chairs, and essential equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>WASH Facilities (Water, sanitation and hygiene)</strong>: Ensuring access to clean drinking water, functional toilets, and hygienic sanitation facilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Materials</strong>: Supplying textbooks, teaching aids, and technological tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Playgrounds and Sports Equipment</strong>: Creating spaces for extracurricular activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Libraries and Digital Learning Centers</strong>: Establishing libraries and computer labs to foster a culture of reading and digital literacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Professor Gopal Naik – Our Guiding Light</h3>
    <p>Professor <strong>Gopal Naik</strong> from IIM Bangalore has been instrumental in shaping the vision of this initiative. With his extensive experience in management, social impact, and education, Professor Naik has provided invaluable guidance, helping steer the project toward success.</p>
    <p>Professor <strong>Gopal Naik</strong> is the <strong>JJM Chair Professor</strong> at IIM Bangalore (IIMB) and also serves as a <strong>Senior Fellow</strong> at the Centre for Public Policy at IIMB. His research focuses on agricultural and environmental economics, rural development, and technology adoption. He has received several prestigious awards, including the <strong>Dr. D.K. Desai Award</strong> and the <strong>American Agricultural Economics Association Award</strong>.</p>
    <p>Professor Naik has held consultancy positions in both national and international organizations and has made significant contributions to government committees and policymaking. He also spearheaded the <strong>Unnat Bharat Abhiyan</strong> and led the development of <strong>SAMIE</strong>, a tele-education project recognized with the <strong>WSIS 2015 Award</strong>.</p>

    <!-- Our Projects Section -->
    <section id="projects" class="projects">
        <h2>Our Current Projects</h2>
        <p>We have identified key areas where schools are in dire need of support. Our approach is data-driven and research-based, ensuring that each project is tailored to meet the specific needs of the schools. Here are some of the major ongoing projects:</p>

                <h3>Infrastructure Development</h3>
                <p>Many schools in rural areas lack proper infrastructure. Some classrooms are overcrowded, while others lack basic facilities such as toilets, electricity, or drinking water. Our goal is to provide funding for the construction of additional classrooms, WASH facilities, and playgrounds that foster a healthy and safe learning environment for students.</p>

                <h3>Technology in Education</h3>
                <p>In today’s digital world, technology plays a crucial role in shaping education. However, many schools still lack computers, projectors, or internet connectivity. Our initiative aims to equip schools with the necessary tools, including smart boards, tablets, and computers, while also providing capacity building for teachers and students.</p>

                <h3>Capacity Building for teachers and students</h3>
                <p>Capacity building for teachers and students is key to enhancing educational outcomes. By equipping teachers with modern teaching techniques, child psychology knowledge, and effective classroom management strategies, we ensure they are prepared to meet the diverse needs of their students.</p>
